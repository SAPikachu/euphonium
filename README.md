A DNS server written in Rust. Currently in early-alpha stage. This is mostly a toy project used to learn Rust, and not supposed to be used in production (at this moment).

## Planned features and ideas

* Recursive resolver
* Aggresive caching
* Mix forwarder and recursive resolver to offer fast and correct result
* DNSSEC
* Detect GFW-poisoned domains by DNSSEC?
